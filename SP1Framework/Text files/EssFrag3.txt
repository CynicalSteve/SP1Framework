“Have you ever seen a creature this bizarre? I mean it’s pretty much a mermaid lion,”
Terrence said as snapped a picture of the merlion statue.

“Singapore’s a pretty superstitious country after all, or at least in the past it used to be,” I said,
glancing at the hoards of tourists around us.
 
”But it’s a beautiful country. I wonder what it takes to raise our children in such a place.”

As I stroked my protruding belly, I could’ve sworn I felt the little one kick in agreement. 

Terrence chuckled as he took more photos. He always had an interest in photography. 

“I would like to,” he responded, “if only the prices here weren’t as high as its skyscrapers.”

“How long are you gonna keep taking those photos?” I said, furiously fanning myself with the pamphlets and maps I was holding.

“Hang on, just one more picture…” he replied, aiming the camera at me.

SNAP!
