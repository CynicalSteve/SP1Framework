“So Ava, I heard that the company Terence was working became bankrupt. Are you two holding up alright?”
Matilda Lindow, the neighbour, asked.

“I-um, well, uh…” I stuttered. 

“We owe a few people some money, that’s all. No big deal Matilda.”

“Sweetie,” Matilda said, cupping my hands in hers, “I know a liar when I see one. 
How do you think I can keep Danny as my husband all these years? Please, tell me what’s wrong.”

My eyes went misty as tears formed in the corner of my eyes.

“It-it’s just that recently Terence has been coming home really late drunk, 
and then he just starts yelling and screaming. One night, I smelt perfume on him and...and…” 
The tears had already cascaded down my cheeks, but I wiped them off with forearm and regained my composure. 

“It’s nothing,” I said, smiling.
