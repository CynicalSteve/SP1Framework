“What did you just say Terence?” Ava asked in a dangerous voice.

“I said I’m leaving you Ava, and I’m taking the kids with me.”

Ava’s face twisted into the most sinister sneer Terence had ever seen.

“Oh really? Which harlot are running you off with?”

“It’s not because of some woman you’ve made up Ava, it’s because...you’re an evil woman. 
The kids are terrified of you. I’m terrified of you too, of what you can do. 
That’s why I’m leaving” Terence said.

Ava let out a laugh, a laughter so chilling that it sent a shiver down his spine.

“What makes you think that you can win the custody of the kids? 
Once I cook up some sob story the jury will throw your ass in prison for domestic violence.”

Terence gulped. “The court wouldn’t listen unless you have proof.”
