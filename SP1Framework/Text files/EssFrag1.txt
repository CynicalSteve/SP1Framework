                                                                                                             
"First, you get the flattest rock you can find like this one,"                                               
 he said, brandishing the stone he just picked from the ground.                                              
 "Next, you aim it at an angle like so... ", he continued,                                                   
 "while adding a little spin to it, you throw as hard as you can."                                           
 
 At the last word of his sentence, he hurled the stone towards the lake.                                     
 It skipped five times across the surface of the water before plopping into the depths below.                
 "Now you try it," he said with a proud look on his face.                                                    
 
 I wrinkled my nose at him, before grabbing a stone from the ground and tossed it at the lake.               
 It skipped eight times on the surface before sinking.                                                       
 
 He stared at me in disbelief. "Damn Ava, nice throw!"                                                       
 "Or maybe you're just bad at it," I snorted.                                                                
 
 His eyes twinkled mischievously.                                                                            
 "Oh yeah? I'll show you something I'm not bad at!"
 He raced towards me and slung me over his shoulder.
 
 He then ran towards the treeline with us both, laughing the whole time.
