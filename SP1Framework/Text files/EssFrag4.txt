"Ah, Mrs Laurens! Fancy meeting you here!"
 
It was our neighbour, Mrs Lindow.

"Mrs Lindow, so great to see you here! How have you been?"

"Good! Are you walking your kids home from the grocery store?"

"Yes," I said, "this is Sasha, 11, and her brother Jonathan, 9. Say hi to Mrs Lindow, children."

They remained silent however, with their eyes glued to the ground.

"Ah, pardon their rudeness. They must be shy meeting someone new after moving here."

"Ohohoho, nothing to worry," she said. "I must get going now, see you later!"

"Bye," I said, waving as she continued down the pavement.
