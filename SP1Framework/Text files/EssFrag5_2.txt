Matilda had been staring at me intensely. "Dear, if you need anything... Good Lord, are those...?!"

I realized that she had spotted the bruises and burn marks on my right thigh, 
so I swiftly pulled down the hem of my skirt.

"I-um, really have to get going now,” I said quickly while standing up from the sofa just as fast. 

"Thank you for having me he-"

"Ava," Matilda interrupted, her eyes burning with anger.

"If that man dares to lay a finger on you or your children, promise that you'll holler. 
I'll send the cops on his ass so fast that he won't even see it coming."

I feigned a smile.

"I will."
