“You got all of that didn’t you, Attorney? Yes, yes, thank you.”

Ava’s face turned from one of arrogance to the one of horror. Pure, unadulterated rage streaked through her mind and body, and the next thing she knew, Terence was slumped on the ground while she held a shattered beer bottle. Blood oozed from Terence’s temple where she hit him.

“Crap!” Ava hissed, dropping the bottle to the ground.

 “Sasha! Jonathan! We’re leaving!” She called out.
