“Sasha! Jonathan! We’re leaving!” I called out.

After herding the sleepy children into the car, I sped away into the night without a care for speeding laws.

“Mommy, where are we going?” Sasha timidly asked.

“And where’s Daddy?” Jonathan asked after.
I looked past the headrest and at their worried faces.

“Don’t worry, Daddy wants to take you away from Mommy, but it’s alright now, 
Mommy’s taking you to a happy place.”

They didn’t answer, instead their eyes largened into wide saucers fixated onto the windscreen.

I swung my head back forward, just in time to see the blinding oncoming lights of a truck blaring its horns.

“SHIT!” I screamed, swerving the car to the right.
