Everything was a blurry mess.

I could distinctly hear the kids screaming and crying in the back 
and desperately thumping against the windows. 

What felt like frigid cold water scraped along my shins and soon reached my knees.

A warm liquid oozed from my forehead and down to the tip of my nose, 
before dripping off into whatever's below. 

I blinked once, then twice, as I felt the warmth abandon my body. 

The darkness which came stole my body, its freezing embrace wrapping around me like a lover.

And there was nothing.
